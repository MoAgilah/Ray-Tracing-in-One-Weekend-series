## Project Description

In Ray Tracing in One Weekend, you will construct a straightforward brute-force path tracer. In the upcoming week, you will continue to develop Ray Tracing by incorporating textures, volumes (such as fog), rectangles, instances, lighting, and support for numerous objects through the use of a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). Finally, in Ray Tracing: The Rest Of Your Life, we will explore the mathematics involved in the development of a highly sophisticated ray tracer. It originally started as a project I would work on between commerical releases whilst working for SN Systems ltd.
## Project Aims
To finish the series of books and then implement it via DirectX12 to allow it to be done via real time rendering purposes instead of printing it to that of an image file, I wish to implement a less brute force methodlogy. Predominately I wish to use it to extend my knowledge of ray tracing so that it may be utilised in my career going forward, as a game programmer.
